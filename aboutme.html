						<h2>Hello! My name is Shannon Moquin!</h2>
					</header>
					
					<p>I am a 23 year old female college student in Salt Lake Community College.
					I am currently going for my Associate's Degree in Visual Art and Design: Animation Emphasis.
					I am a visual artist who loves to express stories from animation and cartoon drawings.
					I am always looking for different styles of art that is appealing to how I feel currently.
					This also gives me the opportunity to discover my own personal art drawing style.
					I already feel accomplished with how unique I can make my cartoons, but I would love to improve more on them, make them more "alive".
					</p>
					<p>I used to write stories, but I have a comprehension disorder that makes it harder for me to take in information as well as express it.
					So that means I can't really multi-task well. 
					Plus I feel like writing is not my style of story expression, especially since I can't explain in detail of what scenes are going on.
					I also feel as though my writing style is souly based off of how I speak, and because I can't speak fluently, my writing doesn't look clean.
					At least my essays are better looking, which is a plus for the professional side of my life.
					</p>
					<p>If you want to plan a commission with me, you may contact me through my email since it is easier for me to get to you with my busy schedule:</p>
